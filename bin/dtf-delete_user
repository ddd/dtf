# This script is used to delete existing User entries in the db
# This script will also need to reassign any existing entries such as for their
# Verification Suites, Analysis Cases, and Case Tests to the Public user
# The Public user is a generic user that needs to be created initially so that
# when a user is deleted, their suites are assigned to Public if they wish to
# be kept. The deletion should ask if the suites should be permanently deleted
# or reassigned to Public.
#
# Ex: dtf-delete_user -u|--user @user_name [--all] [--reassign]
# --all means to delete all the user test suites permenantly
# --reassign means reassign test suites to the Public user for reuse by others
#   first, and then delete the specified user.
#
# -u and EITHER --all OR --reassign are _required_ parameters
#
