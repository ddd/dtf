# This script is used to delete existing Verification Suite entries in the db
# The Public user is a generic user that needs to be created initially so that
# when a user is deleted, their suites are assigned to Public if they wish to
# be kept. The deletion should ask if the suites should be permanently deleted
# or reassigned to Public. This applies to all Analysis Cases, and Case Tests
# as well
#
# Ex dtf-delete_vs -u|--user @user_name -n|--name "DTF Testing Suite"
#
# -u and -n are _required_ parameters
